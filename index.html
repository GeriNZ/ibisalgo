  <h1>Algorithm Game</h1>
  <p>
    Meet the Scarlet Ibis, a curious bird eager to attend classes at UWI and learn about the world of algorithms and computational thinking. 
    But like many of us, this little ibis tends to create its own obstacles, making the journey to its goal more challenging than it needs to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your mission? Guide the Scarlet Ibis through the maze of obstacles to reach the UWI logo safely and efficiently. With your help, 
    this determined bird can overcome the barriers and get the education it deserves!

      <h2>Welcome to Your Algorithm Adventure!</h2>
      <p>
        Embark on an exciting challenge where you’ll guide the Scarlet Ibis to its goal—the UWI logo. 
        Along the way, you’ll sharpen your computational thinking and programming skills.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Play:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Write your code:</strong> Use the commands <code>move</code> and <code>turn left</code> to guide the bird.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan carefully:</strong> The goal is to reach the UWI logo in a single flawless attempt.</li>
        <li><strong>Add obstacles:</strong> Click on the grid to place barriers and make the path more challenging.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize your journey:</strong> Create custom functions like <code>turn right</code> to simplify complex moves.</li>
        <li><strong>Reset the game:</strong> Refresh the page to reset the board and start anew.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Built-in Constraints:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can only use two basic commands: <code>move</code> (to move forward) and <code>turn left</code> (to turn 90 degrees counterclockwise).</li>
        <li>Commands are case-sensitive—spelling matters!</li>
        <li>Each function or command must be placed on its own line.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Pro Tips:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Think logically: Break the path into small steps before writing your code.</li>
        <li>Challenge yourself: Add creative obstacle patterns and test your strategies.</li>
        <li>Experiment and learn: Use trial and error to refine your logic.</li>
      </ul>
