  <p>
    Meet the Scarlet Ibis, a curious bird eager to attend classes at UWI and learn about the world of algorithms and computational thinking. 
    But like many of us, this little ibis tends to create its own obstacles, making the journey to its goal more challenging than it needs to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your mission? Guide the Scarlet Ibis through the maze of obstacles to reach the UWI logo safely and efficiently. With your help, 
    this determined bird can overcome the barriers and get the education it deserves!

      <h2>Welcome to Your Algorithm Adventure!</h2>
      <p>
        Guide the Scarlet Ibis to the UWI logo using your coding skills. Choose a challenge level that suits you:
     For all levels: Click on the grid to place obstacles. Don't like the current layout? Refresh the page to start fresh. You should try to write out your full programm and for Scarlet to arrive at her destination in one go. You can tinker with your code as much as you like to make sure she gets to UWI!
      </p>
      
      <h3>Beginners</h3>
      <p>Use only the two basic commands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>move</code>: Moves the bird forward by one cell.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>turn left</code>: Turns the bird 90Â° counterclockwise.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Plan your steps carefully and use these commands to navigate through obstacles.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Intermediate</h3>
      <p>Enhance your code with control structures and egg commands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>For-loops:</strong> Repeat a block of commands a set number of times.
          <br>
          <code>for 3:</code> (followed by indented commands)
          <pre><code>for 3:
        turn left
        move</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>While-loops:</strong> Execute commands repeatedly as long as a condition is met.
          <br>
          <code>while front_clear:</code> (followed by indented commands)
          <pre><code>while front_clear:
        move</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Egg Commands:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li><code>lay egg</code>: Drop an egg on the current cell.</li>
            <li><code>pick up egg</code>: Remove an egg from the current cell (if one exists).</li>
          </ul>
          Use these to mark your path or create patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Expert</h3>
      <p>Combine custom functions with loops and egg commands to solve challenging puzzles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Custom Functions:</strong> Define your own set of commands to simplify complex sequences.
          <br>
          Define a function with:
          <pre><code>function turn_right:
        turn left
        turn left
        turn left</code></pre>
          Then, call it in your main code by simply writing:
          <pre><code>turn_right</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix functions with loops and basic commands to create intricate patterns and sophisticated algorithms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Experiment and have fun on your algorithm adventure!
